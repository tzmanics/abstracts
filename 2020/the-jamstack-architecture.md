The Jamstack is an architectural concept that strives to make the web more accessible to those that use it as well as those that make it. The core concepts of a Jamstack architecture are pre-rendering content when possible, serving it on a Content Deliver Network (CDN), and using client-side JavaScript to call third-party APIs and serverless functions for dynamic interactions and data. What can sites built around these strategies actually accomplish? What can’t be down with these tools?

##Takeaways

This talk will provide you with a better understanding of the the Jamstack architecture consists of. I’ll look into why it is touted as being able to save money and engineering hours all while delivering safe, fast and reliable sites. We’ll look at how you would use Jamstack best practice to create common site tasks and where this approach may not work.
