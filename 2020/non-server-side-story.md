# Non-Server Side Story

It was an unlikely duo: rich, powerful Angular and fast, new-kid-on-the-block JAMstack. No one realized their hidden potential could be so powerful. For so long JAMstack was courted by React, Vue, vanilla JavaScript, but, could it be? All along Angular has been there, and Angular was just what the JAMstack needed to live web appily ever after!

Act I will give you a glimpse of the meet-cute of Angular and JAMstack where they realized just what a match they were for each other. Excited by their capabilities you'll watch them pair code in Act II to create an amazingly light, fast, and functional web app using their two sets of special skills.

You too will be in awe of this beautiful pair.
