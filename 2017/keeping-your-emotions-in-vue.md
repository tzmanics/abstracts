# Keeping Your Emotions In Vue

I usually know I have a meeting an hour before it happens because my calendar alerts me. So, when I was tasked to "check in" with my emotions throughout the day, I realized I needed an app for that :) Let me take you through my journey creating a Vue PWA with the CLI and Kendo UI components that pinged me, network connection or not, to see what I was feeling. 

## Extra Notes
Earlier this year I was tasked to check in throughout the day to see what emotion I was feeling and handed a photocopied list of emotions. Judging from the list of words, it was at least 40 years old.

At that same time, I was trying to figure out what apps could really benefit from the modern technologies used in Progressive Web Apps. Two birds with one app...or something like that. I decided to create an app that could ping a user, whether or not the app was open and independent of their internet connection, to prompt them to choose from a list what emotion they were currently feeling.

I also wanted the user to have a homescreen icon "reminder" whenever they looked at their phone to randomly log their emotions. Come on this fun VUE PWA journey with me to get some tips and code to create your own Vue PWA!
