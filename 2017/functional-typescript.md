# Finding Function TypeScript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, adding optional types, classes, and
modules. When I switched from JavaScript to TypeScript I was not okay. I had
wanted to be like the cool kids and start developing in Functional JavaScript.
So, I decided to try a compromise: find the functions in TypeScript. I'll walk
through the journey of functional programming with TypeScript and the benefits
we gain from function composition.

I know the benefits of functional programming: avoiding shared state, avoiding
mutating state, avoiding side effects. I was just starting to dive into
learning and using function Javascript. So, when I switched careers and had to
start coding Angular applications with TypeScript, I was disheartened.

Instead of giving up on the functional route I decided to research, dig in, and
start writing functions in my TypeScript code. It is a long journey but it is
turning out to be a great brain exercise, especially because there are
practically no code samples that use the functional approach to TypeScript. I
know the benefits outweigh the initial learning curve and I would like to show
everyone the route I traveled to get to this point.

In this session, we'll take an Angular application and re-write the TypeScript
following functional programming methods. We'll discuss how we can approach
each section as a function and the best way to handle its values and
interactions.
