# An API with a Vue

There are a lot of APIs out there but are we giving users the documentation they need to use them? Let's get real meta and create a web app using Vue that utilizes our API to show users examples of _how_ to use our API. We'll be using Apollo, the Vue CLI and Kendo UI components to quickly spin up our site. Hope to see you there!

In this session we'll spin up an Vue application using the Vue CLI and Kendo UI components. Then we'll use Apollo to connect to our API and create live examples in our site showcasing how to use the API. Familiarity with Vue and JavaScript will be handy.
