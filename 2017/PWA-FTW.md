# PWA FTW

Progressive Web Apps For The Win! You may not want to trash your native mobile app for a shiny new PWA but you can definitely get some major wins by upgrading your web app. There‚Äôs a lot of talk about PWAs not being able to compete with native mobile apps, and guess what. It‚Äôs true! That doesn‚Äôt mean we should dismiss them, it means we should take advantage of what they can do for our current web apps.

Let's take our regular, already awesome, Angular app and 'progress' it to include pre-caching, home screen implementation & push notifications to make it faster and more engaging!

# PWA IRL FTW

Progressive Web Apps are not replacing native mobile applications any time soon. Don‚Äôt disregard them just yet! They can take our web applications that we currently have running In Real Life and make them better. By using support for offline caching, push notifications, home screen icons and more, we can use PWAs to make our apps more reliable and engaging, For The Win!

We will walk through creating a simple Angular application using the Kendo UI for Angular library to get started. Then we‚Äôll see how quickly we can upgrade our application to a PWA. Looking into each addition, we‚Äôll discuss why and how this progresses our application.

# PWA IRL FTW (For The Workshop üòâ)

Progressive Web Apps are not replacing native mobile applications any time soon. Don‚Äôt disregard them just yet! They can take our web applications that we currently have running In Real Life and make them better. By using support for offline caching, push notifications, home screen icons and more, we can upgrade our app to a PWA to make it more accessible, reliable and engaging, For The Win!

In order to help you understand how to upgrade a current application, we'll start out with an existing, non-PWA application as our base project. From there we'll break out part of that application into an app shell that we'll cache using a service worker to enhance load time. Next, we'll delve into creating our app manifest so that we can tell mobile devices how to display our app and app icons. Finally, we'll have a section on the powers of service workers to not only implement a few useful service workers but also help us understand these helpers better.

* Remember, Progressive Web Apps are just that, progressive. So, upgrading your current web app to a PWA will not break it, even if the user's OS does not support PWA enhancements. We're just getting them ready for the future üòÅ
