Progressive Web Apps For The Win! You may not want to trash your native mobile app for a shiny new PWA but you can definitely get some major wins by upgrading your web app. There’s a lot of talk about PWAs not being able to compete with native mobile apps, and guess what. It’s true! That doesn’t mean we should dismiss them, it means we should take advantage of what they can do for our current web apps.
