Data Binding & Visualizations with Angular & Kendo UI

You have the data, now how do you feed it to a chart so that you can actually
see what the data means? In this talk we'll write the code to go from data
source to visualization using data binding strategies with Angular & Kendo UI.
Three different strategies we'll concentrate on are from a file, from user
input (using two-way data binding & from a live data source that's
ever-changing. We live in a world with a ridiculous amount of data, let's use
it!

The most common source of data is a file. We'll see how simple it is to add
that file to your Angular application in order to use that data in a Kendo UI
Chart component.

Next, we'll look at how we can get data from user input on a web application.
We'll use two-way data binding to take the user input and add it to our charted
results. This will be a live demo where attendees will be able to participate.

Finally, we'll look at how we pair a live, ever-changing datasource to our
visualization. We'll look at the code to creating a dashboard that keeps us
up-to-date with the latest changes in our GitHub repository.
