# Crafting Visually Accessible Data

We make visualizations in order to translate our data into a more consumable
resource. What about the over 100 million users out there who have visual
disabilities? Are we making it possible for our visualizations to be used by as
many web users as possible?

We'll look into how we can make our visualizations more accessible to people
who are color-blind, using screen readers or screen magnification. Then we'll
discuss  tools we can use to check our progress in making our visualizations
accessible.

Just starting to work with these 3 accessibility points will help our
visualizations be available to more users.
