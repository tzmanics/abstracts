#  IoT PWA + AMP (is it üòé yet?)
Progressive Web Apps are not replacing native mobile applications any time soon. Don‚Äôt disregard them just yet! We can take our web applications that we already have running and make them better. Even if you can't currently take advantage of service workers, it is progressive so you won't negatively effect your app.

But wait, there‚Äôs more! One of the biggest drawbacks of using web apps on mobile is the speed (or lack there of). Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) works to provide a better user experience across many platforms.

I'd like to show you the journey I took creating my app with Node, Angular and Kendo UI to take more control of my Philips Hue lights. Then how and why I made it into a PWA and used AMP to make it more performant an engaging.
