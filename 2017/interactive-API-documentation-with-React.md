# Interactive API Documentation with React

There are a lot of APIs out there but are we giving users the documentation they need to use them? Let's get real meta and create a web app using Vue that utilizes our API to show users examples of how to use our API. We'll be using Apollo, the preact-cli and Kendo UI components to quickly spin up our site. Hope to see you there!

## Extra Notes
There are a lot of APIs out there that are great tools for developers to use but HOW to use them is often left to confusing or shoddy documentation. That is, if documentation exists at all. With this in mind I wanted to create a session that showed how to hook your API up to your React app using GraphQL's Apollo client and offer developers a way to walk users through how to use their API. To start I will cover the steps to create the API that we will be using to help understand the queries we're using and why. Next, we'll walk through the steps and code used to create the React app using the preact-cli so that it will automatically spin up our app as a Progressive Web App. We'll quickly go over the additions that make it a PWA and what that means but leave the full PWA details to the chosen PWA speakers. Inside our new app we'll add the components with Kendo UI's React components to build up our UI. Finally, we'll connect everything to our API using Apollo. I'll have the live demo hosted so everyone can check it out and the code base up so you can try it yourselves!

### Takeaways
The main skill the attendees will gain is how to successfully connect their API to a React front-end. Along with that, they will learn a new way to teach people how to use their API, how to use the preact cli to create a React PWA and how to include native React components from Kendo UI.
