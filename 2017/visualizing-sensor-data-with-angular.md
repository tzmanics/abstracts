# Visualizing Sensor Data with Angular

These days we can easily access many sensors that can provide us with information on everything from air quality and biometrics to gesture and distance detection. All the sensors listed above can actually be found online for under $15! Let's take advantage of all this information by hooking up the input to Kendo UI data visualization charts. If we can't understand and use the information from our sensors what good are they? Thankfully, with Angular and chart components we can visualize all the data from whatever sensors we choose.

# Visualizing Sensor Data with Node.js & Angular

iThese days we can easily access many sensors that can provide us with information on everything from air quality and biometrics to gesture and distance detection. All the sensors listed above can actually be found online for under $15!
Let's take advantage of all this information by hooking up the input to Node.js and outputting data with Kendo UI data visualization charts. If we can't understand and use the information from our sensors what good are they? Thankfully, with Node.js, Angular and chart components we can visualize all the data from whatever sensors we choose.

- Cover information on sensors: what we would use them for, who would use them and why we need that data.
- Discuss the decisions around hardware and software selections.
- Dive into the hardware setup.
- Overview of using Node to gather the information coming from the sensors.
- Walkthrough of the code used to get the data form Node into Kendo UI data visualization charts.
- Demo time!

One of the most important benefits of Node is the low barrier for learning with Node. I jumped back into IoT after a few years out and Node made that re-entry much easier. I want to show everyone else just how easy it is too! More learning, more fun!
