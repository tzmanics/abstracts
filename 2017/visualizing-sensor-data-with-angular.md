# Visualizing Sensor Data with Angular

These days we can easily access many sensors that can provide us with information on everything from air quality and biometrics to gesture and distance detection. All the sensors listed above can actually be found online for under $15! Let's take advantage of all this information by hooking up the input to Kendo UI data visualization charts. If we can't understand and use the information from our sensors what good are they? Thankfully, with Angular and chart components we can visualize all the data from whatever sensors we choose.
