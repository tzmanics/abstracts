# Visualizing Sensor Data with Angular

These days we can easily access many sensors that can provide us with information on everything from air quality and biometrics to gesture and distance detection. All the sensors listed above can actually be found online for under $15! Let's take advantage of all this information by hooking up the input to Kendo UI data visualization charts. If we can't understand and use the information from our sensors what good are they? Thankfully, with Angular and chart components we can visualize all the data from whatever sensors we choose.

# Visualizing Sensor Data with Node.js & Angular

These days we can easily access many sensors that can provide us with information on everything from air quality and biometrics to gesture and distance detection. All the sensors listed above can actually be found online for under $15!
Let's take advantage of all this information by hooking up the input to Node.js and outputting data with Kendo UI data visualization charts. If we can't understand and use the information from our sensors what good are they? Thankfully, with Node.js, Angular and chart components we can visualize all the data from whatever sensors we choose.

- Cover information on sensors: what we would use them for, who would use them and why we need that data.
- Discuss the decisions around hardware and software selections.
- Dive into the hardware setup.
- Overview of using Node to gather the information coming from the sensors.
- Walkthrough of the code used to get the data form Node into Kendo UI data visualization charts.
- Demo time!

One of the most important benefits of Node is the low barrier for learning with Node. I jumped back into IoT after a few years out and Node made that re-entry much easier. I want to show everyone else just how easy it is too! More learning, more fun!

# Visualizing Your Sensor Data

abstract: Sensors can give us a lot of details about interactions and our surroundings. In order to get a good understanding of this information and see patterns we can now tie this input to visualization charts. Using a Tessel 2 Microcontroller & sensors, Angular, Kendo UI and Firebase, I'll walk you from start to finish setting up your sensor, grabbing data and visualizing it in a web application.

notes: I'll walk through the process of setting up a Tessel microcontroller (an open-source, volunteer-run IoT and robotics development platform) and a few of its "plug and play" sensors. Tessel uses JavaScript and NPM, so I'll code out how to send the sensor data up to firebase. Then I'll use firebase, Angular and Kendo UI charts to quickly spin up a visualization of the sensors data. I'll have the sensors there that will be picking up data about the room's surroundings and displaying that data live.

Anyone who is comfortable with JS can get a good amount of info out of this because we'll be using the Angular CLI for an easy start and all the code will be pretty beginner friendly (any that's not I will explain clearly).

This is a great intro to IoT with a purpose! It gives you a cool project try out with tools that make it very accessible and fun. I jumped back into electronics after sometime away to IoT-up my house and am great at explaining how to do it yourself in a fun and entertaining way :)
