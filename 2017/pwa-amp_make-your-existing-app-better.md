# PWAâ€¢AMP: Make Your Existing App Better

Progressive Web Apps are not replacing native mobile applications any time soon. Donâ€™t disregard them just yet! They can take our web applications that we currently have running and make them better. By using support for offline caching, push notifications, home screen icons and more, we can use PWAs to make our apps more reliable and engaging. But wait, there's more. The Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) project uses strategies to speed up and enhance performance of applications. We'll walk through taking an existing, robust Angular application, make it a PWA and AMP-lify it to deliver a more performant and reliable web application. ðŸ¤™
