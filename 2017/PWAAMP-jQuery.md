# PWAAMP - jQuery

Progressive Web Apps (PWA) are getting a lot of attention lately, for good reason. The benefits of PWAs, like offline caching and push notifications, make your web apps more reliable and more engaging. Creating PWAs is becoming even more simple now with project builders like Create React App and the Vue CLI allowing you to immediately generate a PWA.

But wait, there’s more! One of the biggest drawbacks of using web apps on mobile is the speed (or lack there of). Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) works to provide a better user experience across many platforms. This is accomplished with 3 steps: AMP HTML which makes common patterns easy to implement in a performant way, AMP JS library that ensures the fast rendering of the AMP HTML pages and the AMP Cache used to serve cached AMP HTML pages.

We will use the Vie CLI to create a PWA utilizing the Kendo UI jQuery library to quickly make a robust application. Then we’ll implement the AMP structure to see how fast and reliable we can make our application.
