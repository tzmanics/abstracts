# Progressive ~Rock~ Angular Applications
# Creating an Angular Progressive Web App

Of all the new buzzwords of 2017 Progressive Web Apps or PWAs are at the top of the list. Although, the 3-letter acronym is very catchy that's not the only reason people are delving into PWA's. PWA's let you have one project for both web and mobile, allowing your web application to behave like a native mobile application. You can pre-cache key resources so that your application is more reliable even if the network your user is on isn't. The PRPL (push, render, pre-cache and lazy-load) Pattern of PWAs boosts performance to make your application fast. You can even give the user the option to save your app on their homes screen and send web push notifications which can increase overall engagement.

In this presentation we'll take all the PWA benefits and integrate them into an Angular application. We'll step through the creation of the Angular app using the Kendo UI component library that lets us quickly spin up native Angular components. Since all the Kendo UI components we are creating become native Angular components we are able to take advantage of Angular's Ahead-of-Time compilation, Universal Rendering and Tree-Shaking right out of the box. Once our Angular app is created we can integrate the PWA code to make our app even more proficient.
