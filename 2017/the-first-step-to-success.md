# The First Step to Success is Actually Doing Something: 30 mins to MVP

Us humans, we think a lot. Sometimes we have ideas and *sometimes* they're
actually good ideas. Every human out there that's had a successful, profitable
& world-changing app, all had the same first step: they did something about it.
Let's look at an easy process & method to turn our, sometimes great, ideas into
a viable product in 30 minutes. We'll be creating our project w/ Kendo UI for
Angular.

I have a lot of ideas. I think about them so thoroughly, all the way to the
smallest UI details and my interview about them with Stephen Colbert. Then,
they just fade away. I retire the Moleskine they lived in and I never make it
on the Late Show. (sad trombone)

I started the Women Who Code branch in Cincinnati and it lead me to many
conversations on this very topic. So many coders in my community had THE idea;
the one they really wanted to see come alive. This line in the conversation
would indubitably lead to "but <insert excuse here>."

I want to end all "but"s.

The process began with myself. I had an idea for an app that I had been talking
about for ages. I finally just said " whatever" and slapped something together
that looked awful. I didn't pick a font, I didn't choose a color palette and I
didn't spellcheck üòè  I just made the very first step off the app: user input
with two-way data binding and a calculated output. It happened faster than I
guessed and suddenly my idea was on the screen. üéâ Once you have SOMETHING it's
easier to figure out your next step.

You can't debug code that doesn't exist.

I want to show everyone that they can do this too. I will walk them through the
process of focusing on the core aspect of their idea then immediately putting
pixels on the screen.  The method is:
- title your idea (you only have a 1 min. timer than you deal w what you got)
- what's the core function (what do people do, see, experience)
- what's the first interaction (filling out a form, seeing a list of pictures,
  uploading a picture)
- code that, JUST that!

Simple, I know, but so much time gets spent on extra, time-wasting factors: an
hour on Google Fonts, 2 hours on coolors.co, 3 hours on stock images, etc.

We'll drill down using Kendo UI for Angular & the angular-cli making a project
in 30 minutes or less. In the end I'll reveal that the project we actual made
is a tool that pics a random font, color scheme and logo image FOR you. They
come out horrendous, it's hilariously ugly. You never know though, it could be
the exact fit for the next Twitter that actually makes a profit. üòõ

That's it. Hope you're intrigued. Thanks for your time!
