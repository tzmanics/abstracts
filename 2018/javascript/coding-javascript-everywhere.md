# Coding JavaScript Everywhere

## Abstract
The growth in usage of JavaScript in undeniable. Being able to seamlessly develop from back-end to front-end has obvious benefits for developers and companies of every size. Currently there are roadblocks to harmoniously coding JavaScript everywhere. We'll discuss what those challenges are and what we can do to solve them as well as the best way to start prepping for a JavaScript takeover.

## Details
After a career using Node on the back-end, I switched to more work using JS on the front-end. It was interesting to me that there were differences that made the switch back and forth bumpy. Since this realization I've started to research what needs to change to make this journey seamless. 

I think this is valuable information for developers and business owners. With JS everywhere, a developer can hone their skills in one language and be able to code end-to-end.

A few things that will be discussed are:
- how to currently  use JS on front and back
- the module dilemna
- Node APIs || Web APIs

##Takeaways
Most developers would benefit from the talk. They would gain understanding of where JavaScript is and what changes could come soon to change the development process.
