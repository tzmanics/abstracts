# The Future of JavaScript: 2018 and Beyond
JavaScript is ever-changing and is as popular as ever. In this session, we'll run through where JavaScript is now and where it is headed. We'll discuss the evolution of ECMAScript delving into what ES2017 gave us and what's being delivered in the ES2018 release. Of course, in covering JavaScript it is important to cover surrounding libraries, tools and web strategies. We'll cover what's going on with Angular, React and Vue; taking a peak into what has changed in each library and the growing communities that surround them. Finally, we'll look into the popular package managers, JS on the server and how you can progress your apps with JS and Progressive Web App technologies. Catch up on one of the most popular languages and have fun doing it!
