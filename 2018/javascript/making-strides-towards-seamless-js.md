# Making Strides Towards Seamless JavaScript

## Abstract
There are obvious benefits to being able to seamlessly use JavaScript on the front-end and back-end of the web. For developers, we are able to focus on honing our skills on one language. For teams, communication across projects can be clearer with a central language everyone knows. This is just skimming the surface. In this talk, I'll go over where JS is in the process of becoming seamless, what stands in the way and what we can do to start clearing the path.

## Description
The first part of the talk will cover the over-arching story of JS usage:
- the growth in JS usage
- the different ways/platforms where JS can already be used
- the benefits of making the usage of JS more seamless across all the places it can be used

The second part of the talk will go into the challenges that are currently blocking:
- differences between commonjs modules and es6 modules + the process of Node's adoption of ESM
- where node and web APIs differ or overlap and how the API worlds need to merge or adapt
- other instances where web and Node currently differ
*Note: I am currently digging more into this information and will continue too*

The final section of my talk will focus on what people can do to help with this process:
- joining working groups
- contributing to OSS like core and more
- getting their companies to contribute time, money and/or engineers to this goal

I'll end by recapping all of this and highlighting why it's important for us to one day get to seamless JS. 

## Takeaways
This sheds more light on the process that JS & Node have to go through to become seamless. Focusing on the benefits, the challenges and the things we can do to help the process along. After learning what was standing in the way and that I could possibly help move the process along somehow, I was very motivated. I'd like to share what I've learned and hope to motivate more people.
