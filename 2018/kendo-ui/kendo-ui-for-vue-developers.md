# Kendo UI for Vue Developers
Vue is a JavaScript library that is getting lots of attention and gaining more users lately. Vue is light, flexible and powerful lending itself to easy adoption for JQuery and AngularJS users or a great place to start for anyone. Kendo UI has released a component library for the Vue library that allows you to build up your Vue app to be more robust faster. In this session we'll build a Vue application using the Vue CLI and Kendo UI to give us styled components that follow accessibility standards without any extra coding. Since Kendo UI components are also responisive we'll be able to work with the Vue CLI's Progressive Web App template to quickly make our Vue app mobile-friendly. If you want to learn a faster and more efficient way to build your Vue apps or learn more, come code with me!
