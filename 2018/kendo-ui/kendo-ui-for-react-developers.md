# Kendo UI for React Developers
There is no doubt React is the hot library right now, even topping JQuery in job listings (which hasn't been done in a decade). React helps you build UIs and using Kendo UI components makes the task faster and easier. The Kendo team has just released a library of true React components giving you styled and responsive compnents that follow accessibility standards right out of the box. This new library gives you the option of using the Kendo components made from the ground up specifically for React or their JQuery wrapper counterparts. In this session we'll build up a robust application in React using Kendo UI's everyday components like dropdowns and calendars, to the more robust grid and visualization components. If you're already using React and want fast, reliable components or if you want to learn what React and Kendo UI can help you build, come check it out!
