# For the Love of Plants starring Tessel and React

## Abstract
Join me in coding out a system for your plants that updates you on light and moisture levels using a Tessel board and React UI. Understand how to retrieve and utilize sensor data. May another plant never die on your watch!

## Details
I've killed a lot of plants. I love building electronics projects. Non sequitur? No way. In order to stop the flora massacre this project ties in a database of plant information with sensor data of the plant's current moisture and light conditions.

In this session, we'll code up the sensors using the Tessel open source libraries and microcontroller. Once we have the data being sent to our database, we can move on to the UI. We'll spin up the UI using create-react-app, then combine the plant database and the sensor database. Once we have all the data we can set up push notifications to remind us NOT to kill plants üòÅ

This project is specific to plants, but the concept of connecting static information and dynamic data from sensors into a handy web app can be used as you wish. Come ready to code and save some plants from imminent demise.

## Takeaways
Learn how to use the Tessel open source libraries to collect sensor data. Build a UI that utilizes that sensor data to send notifications using service workers.
