# Write/Speak/Code == Developer Advocate

## Abstract
I started out as a Software Engineer and I loved it. I decided to give back to the community that helped me out as I was learning to _be_ a SE. I started the Women Who Code in Cincy then helped with the NodeSchool chapter. My work in the community lead people to reach out to me about a career as a Developer Advocate. I said yes. Now I still write code but I also write about it, make videos, speak at conferences and travel the world. I'd love to share with you this amazing career and how you can do it too!

## Details
On a weekly basis I code out demos, write blog posts, record video tutorials and speak somewhere different in the world. That is a busy week, but it's not extremely rare. I meet more and more women and marginalized people who are unaware of this career and I want to see more of them represented. Am I selfishly trying to bring more amazing people into my field? Yes, but I think they and the community would highly benefit from it.

In this talk I would like to introduce people to my experience as a Developer Advocate, both good and bad. I'll also talk about strategies I've learned to write, speak, code and record videos.

## Takeaways
Anyone with any technical level can be reached with this talk. I especially think it will be interesting for those starting in careers and those wanting to switch careers.
