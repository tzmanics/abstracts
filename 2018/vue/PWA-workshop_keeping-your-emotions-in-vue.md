# PWA Workshop: Keeping Your Emotions in Vue

## Abstract
Building a Progressive Web App is a great way to make your web app more engaging and reliable. In this workshop we'll go over what a PWA is, where it's supported and what the benefits are. Then we'll dive in and build one out using the Vue CLI. The PWA we create will use offline caching to load information without at network connection and send push notifications to remind a user to check-in with their emotions each day.

## Details
Earlier this year I was tasked with checking in throughout the day to see what emotion I was feeling and handed a photocopied list of emotions. Judging from the list of words, it was at least 40 years old.

At that same time, I was trying to figure out what apps could really benefit from the modern technologies used in Progressive Web Apps. Two birds with one app. I decided to create an app that could ping a user, whether or not the app was open and independent of their internet connection, to prompt them to choose from a list what emotion they were currently feeling.I also wanted the user to have a homescreen icon "reminder" whenever they looked at their phone to randomly log their emotions.

I'll give a succinct explanation of what PWAs are and their advantages. Then we'll walk through each step necessary to code a Vue PWA using the Vue CLI. 

## Takeaways
Developers with moderate technical levels will do best in this workshop. Attendees will gain a better understanding of the steps to take and how to code a progressive web app, including creating service workers and the push API. They will also have a code base to reference when they get started. Added bonus: they may get more in touch with their emotions ðŸ¤—
