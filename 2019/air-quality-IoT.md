# Open Sourcing Air Quality 

## Absrtract
We've come so far making IoT really accessible, thanks to JS, we can now put it into action to educate ourselves and our neighbors about the conditions we live in. My neighbors and I always complained about the smell in our neighborhood only to find out recently that we had the worst air quality, by far, in our city. Although we were suspicious, we never had any data or solid proof to back it up. Let me walk you through the process of building out user-friendly IoT and crowd-sourcing data to help you clear any smog of doubt you may have in your neighborhood.

I've worked with IoT for hobby projects in the past & was always trying to find ways to showcase how libraries and hardware like Johnny-5 & Tessel make working with IoT very accessible. My non-technical neighbors were really intrigued by the idea of being able to track their air quality, especially when we made the news for the record amount of pollution in our area from local factories. Putting these two goals together made for a really interesting challenge that I would love to tell you about.
