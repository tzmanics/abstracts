# ES2019 Features: What Even Are They?

## Abstract
Thankfully, every year ECMAScript gives us new shinies to advance how we code JavaScript. I've found myself digging into features & proposals ever since my curiosity of ES2017's `SharedArrayBuffer` took me down a fascinating rabbit hole. Let's delve into some of the features & proposals we get to look forward to in 2019.

## Extra Information
There are already two features that are planned for ES2019 (Optional `catch` binding and JSON superset), but I've started keeping a close eye on Stage 3 proposals that may be released for ES2019. I would be sure to mention each feature but really look deep into the cool ones :)

I'll review my data with members of TC39 & Dr. Axel Rauschmayer.

I find a lot of joy in looking into the technical intricacies of these parts of our language and breaking it down into bite-size, consumable brain treats.
